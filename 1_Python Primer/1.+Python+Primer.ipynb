    "We will start with the concept of a variable, which is merely a representation of a changeable value.  There are a few special words which you cannot call a variable, such as `class`, otherwise most combinations of letters, numbers and underscores can be used.  Variables are case sensitive.  \n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outset, the first thing we need to emphasise is the concept of _assignment_ of a variable.  When we use the `=` symbol, we are assigning a value to an existing variable.  This is not the same meaning as in a mathematical equation which implies the two sides of the sign are equal.  The outcome of this is that you can have valid statements such as `x = x + 1`, which would increase the value of `x` by 1, rather than being a statement of truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, and many modern programming languages _equivalence_ is represented as `==` i.e., two equals signs.  So, by saying `x == x`, you are making a (correct) statement about the variable `x`.  The output of this statement therefore would be `True`.  If by contrast, you were to say `x == x + 1`, this is another statement, which is incorrect.  The outcome of this would therefore be `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the code below for some examples.  You can run code in the browser by selecting the cell, and then pressing `Crtl` + `Enter`, or by using the \"play\" button on the menu above."
